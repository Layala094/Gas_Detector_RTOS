This project implements a stationary gas leak detector using an STM32F446RE microcontroller, an MQ‑9 gas sensor, and a 1602 LCD display. The device continuously measures gas concentration levels (CO and CH₄), converts raw ADC readings into calibrated PPM values, displays them to the user, and triggers an alarm when dangerous thresholds are exceeded. The firmware is built using FreeRTOS with clean task separation, queue‑based inter‑task communication, and a modular driver architecture.
